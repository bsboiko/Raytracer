# Raytracer

This is a Raytracer implementation written in C. It comes pre-built with a couple of shaders, a couple of light types, a camera struct, and geometry.

## Geometry

Spheres are defined by an origin and radius. 

The other geometry type is a triangle, from which any geometry can be defined.

These two methods allow for the definition of any geometry.

## Lights

Ambient and directional lights exists.

## Camera

Currently only support for perspective cameras. 

## Shaders

Lambert and Phong shaders can be specified.
